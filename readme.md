# TR Reader

Rust library crate that provides data structures for handling Tomb Raider level file data. Currently only supports TR4 level files. Uses the [tr_readable](https://github.com/Ababwa/tr_readable) trait and [tr_derive](https://github.com/Ababwa/tr_derive) derive macro.

Developed using the [TR Wiki](https://trwiki.earvillage.net/doku.php?id=trs:file_formats) as a reference.
